# Documentation Index

This is the index of the documentation for various Python scripts. Each script serves a specific purpose in processing and analyzing protein interaction data. Please refer to the individual documentation files for more information on each script.

- [distance.md](distance.md): Calculates the average distance and occurrences of interacting residues in multiple TSV files.
- [similarity.md](similarity.md): Computes the Jaccard Index similarity between TSV files (of interaction data) using either all columns or just the residue numbers.
- [interface.md](interface.md): Determines the presence and recurrence of a given Chain-Residue pair in multiple TSV files containing interaction data.
- [partners.md](partners.md): Determines the interaction partners (and frequency of interaction) of a given Chain-Residue pair in multiple TSV files.
